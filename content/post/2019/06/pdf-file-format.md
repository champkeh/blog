# Understanding the PDF File Format: Overview

At [IDR Solutions](https://www.idrsolutions.com/) we have being developing
a range of PDF software since 1999. We have a [Java PDF Viewer and SDK](https://www.idrsolutions.com/jpedal), 
an [Acrobat forms to HTML5 converter](https://www.idrsolutions.com/pdf2html5),
a [PDF to HTML5 converter](https://www.idrsolutions.com/pdf2html5) and a [Java ImageIO replacement](https://www.idrsolutions.com/jdeli). This has given us 
a lot of experience with the PDF file format and we have tried to share this knowledge
on our blog.  If you really want to know what goes on inside PDF files, these articles
will give you all the details!

This is part 1 of the index, which is aimed to give an overview of the format.
In part 2, we talk a lot more about [PDF bugs, gotchas and tips](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2013/01/understanding-the-pdf-file-format-bugs-gotchas-and-tips/)!
